# What is this?
This is the source to snail.rocks.

If you're looking for any shaders/vrc things you've ended up at the wrong spot.

# Helping
I appreciate help wherever provided!

## If there's something broken/wrong 
### And you can fix it
Go ahead and fix it and send me a pull request or the files themselves and I'll take a look!

### And you can't fix it
Send me a message and I'll maybe get around to it. 
I do all of this sort of as the mood suites me so no promises.

## Nothing's wrong, just had an idea
Awesome :) Try making it!
If you have no idea where to start, message me and I'll try to help you get started.

Or if you just want to throw an idea at me you can do that too!
